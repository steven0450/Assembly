# Report

## 1. Which instruction pushes all of the 32-bit general-purpose registers on the stack?

## 2. Which instruction pushes the 32-bit EFLAGS register on the stack?

## 3. Which instruction pops the stack into the EFLAGS register?
## 4. Challenge: Another assembler (called NASM) permits the PUSH instruction to list multiple specific registers. Why might this approach be better than the PUSHAD instruction in MASM? Here is a NASM example:
```asm
PUSH EAX EBX ECX
```

## 5. Challenge: Suppose there were no PUSH instruction. Write a sequence of two other instructions that would accomplish the same as push eax.

## 6. (True/False): The RET instruction pops the top of the stack into the instruction pointer.
## 7. (True/False): Nested procedure calls are not permitted by the Microsoft assembler unless the NESTED operator is used in the procedure definition.

## 8. (True/False): In protected mode, each procedure call uses a minimum of 4 bytes of stack space.

## 9. (True/False): The ESI and EDI registers cannot be used when passing 32-bit parameters to procedures.

## 10. (True/False): The ArraySum procedure (Section 5.2.5) receives a pointer to any array of double words.

## 11. (True/False): The USES operator lets you name all registers that are modified within a procedure.

## 12. (True/False): The USES operator only generates PUSH instructions, so you must code POP instructions yourself.

## 13. (True/False): The register list in the USES directive must use commas to separate the register names.

## 14. Which statement(s) in the ArraySum procedure (Section 5.2.5) would have to be modified so it could accumulate an array of 16-bit words? Create such a version of ArraySum and test it.

## 15. What will be the final value in EAX after these instructions execute?
```asm
push 5
push 6
pop eax
pop eax
```

## 16. Which statement is true about what will happen when the example code runs?
```asm
 1: main PROC
 2: push 10
 3: push 20
 4: call Ex2Sub
 5: pop eax
 6: INVOKE ExitProcess,0
 7: main ENDP
 8:
 9: Ex2Sub PROC
10: pop eax
11: ret
12: Ex2Sub ENDP
```

a. EAX will equal 10 on line 6

b. The program will halt with a runtime error on Line 10

c. EAX will equal 20 on line 6

d. The program will halt with a runtime error on Line 11

## 17. Which statement is true about what will happen when the example code runs?
```asm
 1: main PROC
 2: mov eax,30
 3: push eax
 4: push 40
 5: call Ex3Sub
 6: INVOKE ExitProcess,0
 7: main ENDP
 8:
 9: Ex3Sub PROC
10: pusha
11: mov eax,80
12: popa
13: ret
14: Ex3Sub ENDP
```

a. EAX will equal 40 on line 6

b. The program will halt with a runtime error on Line 6

c. EAX will equal 30 on line 6

d. The program will halt with a runtime error on Line 13

## 18. Which statement is true about what will happen when the example code runs?
```asm
 1: main PROC
 2: mov eax,40
 3: push offset Here
 4: jmp Ex4Sub
 5: Here:
 6: mov eax,30
 7: INVOKE ExitProcess,0
 8: main ENDP
 9:
10: Ex4Sub PROC
11: ret
12: Ex4Sub ENDP
```

a. EAX will equal 30 on line 7

b. The program will halt with a runtime error on Line 4

c. EAX will equal 30 on line 6

d. The program will halt with a runtime error on Line 11

## 19. Which statement is true about what will happen when the example code runs?
```asm
 1: main PROC
 2: mov edx,0
 3: mov eax,40
 4: push eax
 5: call Ex5Sub
 6: INVOKE ExitProcess,0
 7: main ENDP
 8:
 9: Ex5Sub PROC
10: pop eax
11: pop edx
12: push eax
13: ret
14: Ex5Sub ENDP
```

a. EDX will equal 40 on line 6

b. The program will halt with a runtime error on Line 13

c. EDX will equal 0 on line 6

d. The program will halt with a runtime error on Line 11

## 20. What values will be written to the array when the following code executes?
```asm
.data
array DWORD 4 DUP(0)
.code
