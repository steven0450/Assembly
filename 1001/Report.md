```

## 2. What will be the value in EAX after the following lines execute?

```asm
mov eax,1002FFFFh
inc ax
```

## 3. What will be the value in EAX after the following lines execute?

```asm

```

## 6. What will be the value of EAX and the Sign flag after the following lines execute?

```asm
mov eax,5
sub eax,6
```

## 7. In the following code, the value in AL is intended to be a signed byte. Explain how the Overflow flag helps, or does not help you, to determine whether the final value in AL falls within a valid signed range.

```asm
mov al,-1
add al,130
```

## 8. What value will RAX contain after the following instruction executes?

```asm
mov rax,44445555h
```

## 9. What value will RAX contain after the following instructions execute?

```asm
.data
dwordVal DWORD 84326732h
.code
mov rax,0FFFFFFFF00000000h
mov rax,dwordVal
```

## 10. What value will EAX contain after the following instructions execute?

```asm
.data
dVal DWORD 12345678h
.code
mov ax,3
mov WORD PTR dVal+2,ax
mov eax,dVal
```

## 11. What will EAX contain after the following instructions execute?

```asm
.data
.dVal DWORD ?
.code
mov dVal,12345678h
mov ax,WORD PTR dVal+2
add ax,3
mov WORD PTR dVal,ax
mov eax,dVal

## 12. (Yes/No): Is it possible to set the Overflow flag if you add a positive integer to a negative integer?

## 13. (Yes/No): Will the Overflow flag be set if you add a negative integer to a negative integer and produce a positive result?

## 14. (Yes/No): Is it possible for the NEG instruction to set the Overflow flag?

## 15. (Yes/No): Is it possible for both the Sign and Zero flags to be set at the same time? Use the following variable definitions for Questions 16–19:

```asm
.data
var1 SBYTE -4,-2,3,1
var2 WORD 1000h,2000h,3000h,4000h
var3 SWORD -16,-42
var4 DWORD 1,2,3,4,5
```

## 16. For each of the following statements, state whether or not the instruction is valid:

```asm
a. mov ax,var1?
b. mov ax,var2
c. mov eax,var3
d. mov var2,var3
e. movzx ax,var2
f. movzx var2,al
g. mov ds,ax
h. mov ds,1000h
```

## 17. What will be the hexadecimal value of the destination operand after each of the following instructions execute in sequence?

mov ah,[var1+3] ; b.
```

## 18. What will be the value of the destination operand after each of the following instructions execute in sequence?

```asm
mov ax,var2 ; a.
